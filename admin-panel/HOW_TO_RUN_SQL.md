# How to Run the SQL Migration in Supabase

## You're Already in the Right Place! ✅

You're currently in the Supabase SQL Editor. Here's how to run the migration:

## Steps:

1. **Open the SQL file:**
   - In your code editor, open: `admin-panel/migrations/00_complete_setup.sql`
   - Select ALL content (Cmd/Ctrl + A)
   - Copy it (Cmd/Ctrl + C)

2. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Go back to the Supabase SQL Editor (where you are now)
   - Click in the editor area (where it says "Hit CMD+K...")
   - Paste the SQL (Cmd/Ctrl + V)

3. **Run the SQL:**
   - Click the green **"Run"** button (bottom right)
   - Or press: **Cmd + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows)

4. **Wait for completion:**
   - You'll see a success message: "✅ Database setup complete!"
   - All tables will be created

## That's It!

After running, you'll have all 20+ database tables ready to use.

## Next: Set Up .env.local

After the SQL runs successfully, you need to configure your `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials.
